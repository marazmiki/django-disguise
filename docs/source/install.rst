Installation
------------

To install the package, please use your favorite package manager: ``pip`` (included
in the python standard lib), `pipenv <https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
`poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ or something else. In this documentation,
we will use ``pip``. If you prefer other managers, please refer to the corresponding
manual to learn how to install packages with it.

So, to install the application with pip, just run in a terminal:

.. code:: bash

    $ python -m pip install django-disguise

with it, you get a stable version from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/django-disguise>`_.

Development version:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/marazmiki/django-disguise#egg=django-disguise
