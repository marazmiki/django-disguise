This application allows to a site superuser (or a some staff user authorized for the action)
to *disguise* into an arbitrary user **without knowing own's password and without losing the original session**.

Why "disguise"?
---------------

Have you ever play in `Team Fortress <https://teamfortress.com>`_? If so,
perhaps, I should not answer the question, you've already got it. If you haven't,
well, will try to explain.

**Team Fortress** is a first-person role shooter. `Role` means you can choose one of a few user classes
having own abilities, e.g.

* ``Medic`` can repair damages,
* ``Scout`` runs so fast
* ``Sniper`` has a riffle...

Also there is a wonderful player class called ``Spy``, who has an ability
to take a shape of any other class. Everybody sees a running blue scout while
actually it's a Red Spy.

You can view a short movie, it's quite funny.

So, this skill called **disguise**. And I found this application makes a site superuser into a spy who can acts like a regular user, even without knowing the password.
